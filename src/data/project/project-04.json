        "My final major project focused on step ladder related injury and fatality and ways in which to prevent it. There are a lot of safety requirements and equipment around other areas of working at height but little in the way of protection when it comes to step ladders, I went about creating a ladder that focused on electricians and features that would improve their work flow and stability. The REDEL ladder has a multitude of clever features thet trigger subconcious awareness, with a bottom step that is a different width, texture and colour it tackles one of the biggest causes of injur and death, missing the bottom step. Including features freeing up the hands means greater stability."
