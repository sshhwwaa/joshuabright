        "The brief was to create a product or service for the future, I decided to focus on international shipping and the way in which it is expanding exponentially. I created a service that has already been explored in small scale and made it much bigger, drones are being used to make some delivers for amazon at the moment, I also made the assumption that Airbus would further develop their electric jet egine making aircraft fully electric in the future, by doing this i designed a system where a large Beluga aircraft would maintain a constant flight pattern around europe not needing to land using the drones to drop down and deliver and collect parcels. This would reduce the need for landing and takeoffs by the big planes and would allow the drones to deliver and collect from remote places."
