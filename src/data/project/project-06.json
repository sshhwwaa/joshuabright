        "24 Hours In Bristol is a annual photographic competition I organise, I started in 2014 and continued until 2017 when I stopped to attend university, I intend to restart the event again once the pandemic has stopped restrictions on the events sector. The concept is that entrants have a single 24 hour period to go out and capture the city of Bristol, therefore creating an incredible snapshot of the going ons in the city in one day, I have built the platform to host the event and secured sponsorship from private and public sectors to make this happen. my experience in running art events greatly helped me make this a sucess."
