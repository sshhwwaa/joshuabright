        "With the closure of the gallery in response to the Covid pandemic the gallery lost it's main revenue of income, I therefore set out to quickly create a new stream of income via an online platform to sell work, this meant I needed to create a solid product range which I also print and assemble in house reducing costs and boosting profits. The main task was to create a website that was clear simple to use and showed off the extraordinary products on offer."
