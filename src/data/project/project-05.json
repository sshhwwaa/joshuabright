        "This project was aimed at redisgning a product and making it better, I wanted to create a more apealing and desirable garden lighting system, I wanted to redesign a piller light in an industrial style with sharp lines and an interesting light dispersal pattern, I used steel and glass to achieve this with a paneled light feature. I approached this project by designing for manufacture and therefore ensuring the product could be made and to a set budget making it feasable to sell."
